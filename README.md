# Welcome to Noggin-Loggin

## What We Do:
We create sensors to be placed in helmets used in sports.  This sensor will notify the trainer or bench that this player has received a hit that constitutes potential concussion or head trauma.

## How We Do It:
We have created a tiny sensor that can be placed in the helmet without affecting the weight of the helmet noticibly, or inhibiting the performance of the player.  This sensor then takes continuous measurements of the impact force the helmet undergoes and when a potentially dangerous hit occurs the sideline is notified by a tansmitter so that they may inspect the player.

## Who We Do It For:
Our customers are anyone who plays a sport that wears a helmet.  For example football, hockey, baseball, wrestling head gear, and even rugby headguards.  And our sensors are for all levels from peewee to professional.

## Why We Do It:
Our goal is to prevent head trauma so that these athletes can eventually leave the game and not be worried about potnentially losing their mental capabilities later in life.
